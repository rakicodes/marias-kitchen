# How It's Made
Technologies used: MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS

I built this website using the MERN stack and the MVC framework. The backend uses MongoDB for the database and ExpressJS and NodeJS for the server. The frontend of the website uses ReactJS for the user interface, Redux to manage component state and Bootstrap for styling.


# Optimizations
To optimize I would work on customizing and improving the styling of the website more. I would also the add the option for users to add a picture to the recipe.
